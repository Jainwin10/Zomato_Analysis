# Zomato_Analysis

Project Description

This is a SQL project to analyze the database of Zomato members and gold members, including data about their joining date, date of joining gold membership, the products purchased by them, the different products and their prices, and the rewards points given on each purchase.

The project can be used to answer a variety of questions, such as:

Which products are most popular among Zomato members?
How much money do Zomato members spend on average?
What is the impact of gold membership on spending?
How effective are Zomato's rewards program?
The project can also be used to identify trends and patterns in consumer behavior. For example, the project could be used to identify which products are becoming more or less popular over time, or to identify which products are more likely to be purchased by gold members than by regular members.
